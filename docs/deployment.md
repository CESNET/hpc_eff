# Deploy a node

Configuring, running, verifying, and tuning one node. Build and install the
package first with [install.md](install.md); when this node is working,
[cluster-rollout.md](cluster-rollout.md) covers the rest of the fleet.

A compute node caps its CPU maximum frequency according to whichever signal
`[MODE] control_mode` selects:

| Mode | Description | Use case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `co2` | Price/CO₂ regulator only | Cost and carbon optimisation |
| `temperature` | Temperature regulator + NVIDIA GPU power | Thermal management, datacenter continuity |

`control_mode` is the single switch for the whole node — there are no separate
feature flags to set. It is required; an unset or unknown value aborts the run.
The CPU is driven by either temperature or price/CO₂, never both. GPU power
regulation rides along with `temperature` mode only (NVIDIA GPUs only; safely
no-ops on nodes without them).

Neither mode is a fallback for the other. Pick per node according to what
actually constrains it. What each mode does with its input is explained in
[regulation-modes.md](regulation-modes.md).

---

## 1. Configure

Edit `/etc/hpc_eff/config.ini`. If it is missing for any reason:

```bash
sudo install -D -m 640 /etc/hpc_eff/config.ini.example /etc/hpc_eff/config.ini
```

`[MODE] control_mode` is required in both modes. An unset or unknown value
aborts the run rather than doing nothing. Everything else below depends on
which mode you picked.

`[SYSTEM] POWERREADINGCMD` (`ipmitool dcmi power reading`) is logging-only in
both modes. Leave it as is if you have no BMC; the failure is caught.

### Mode: `co2`

The four things to set beyond the mode itself:

| Section / key | Set it to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `[CO2_API] TYPE` | `nowtricity` or `wattnet` | Picks the backend. |
| `[CO2_API] NOWTRICITY_API_KEY` | your key | Also set `NOWTRICITY_USER_AGENT` to something identifying your site. |
| `[frequency_tables]` | frequencies for your CPU, MHz, highest first | See [the frequency table](#co2-mode-the-frequency-table). |
| `[aggregation]` | `rating_type` and weights | See below. |

Minimum working `co2` config:

```ini
[SYSTEM]
SCORENAME=SPEC2017
SCORE=3.8
POWERREADINGCMD=ipmitool dcmi power reading
DEBUG=yes

[MODE]
control_mode=co2

[CO2_API]
TYPE=nowtricity
NOWTRICITY_USER_AGENT=fzu-throttlepoint
NOWTRICITY_API_KEY=<your key>
NOWTRICITY_BASE_URL=https://www.nowtricity.com/api
NOWTRICITY_ZONE=czech-republic

[aggregation]
rating_type=average
weight_price=0.6
weight_co2=0.4

[frequency_tables]
amd_epyc=2400,2000,1500
default=3000,2800,2700,2600,2400,2200

[logging]
db_path=/var/lib/hpc_eff/history.db
state_json_path=/var/lib/hpc_eff/state.json
history_length=1000
log_level=INFO
```

> **Caution:** the config file holds an API key and the package installs it
> mode 644. Tighten it with `sudo chmod 640 /etc/hpc_eff/config.ini`. Nothing
> needs it world-readable; it only ever runs as root.

#### Choosing how conservative to be

`[aggregation] rating_type` decides how the two signals combine:

| Value | Effect | When to pick it |
|---|---|---|
| `average` | Weighted mean (default 0.6 price / 0.4 CO₂) | Balanced; the recommended default to start from |
| `max` | The worse of the two: throttle if *either* is bad | Maximum carbon and cost avoidance, most throttling |
| `price` | Price only, CO₂ ignored | Pure cost optimisation, or no CO₂ API key yet |

The reasoning behind the 0.6/0.4 split is in
[regulation-modes.md](regulation-modes.md#why-price-is-weighted-higher-than-carbon).

### Mode: `temperature`

The two things to set beyond the mode itself:

| Section / key | Set it to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `[TEMPERATURE_SOURCE]` | `TYPE` = `ipmi`, `http_api`, or `custom`, plus its keys | The only input this mode has. See below. |
| `[CPU_THERMO]` | band limits (°C) and target frequencies for your CPU | See [the thermal bands](#temperature-mode-the-thermal-bands). |

`[GPU_POWER]` matters only on NVIDIA nodes; the section is safely ignored
elsewhere. No `[CO2_API]`, `[aggregation]`, or `[frequency_tables]` keys are
read in this mode.

Minimum working `temperature` config:

```ini
[SYSTEM]
SCORENAME=SPEC2017
SCORE=3.8
POWERREADINGCMD=ipmitool dcmi power reading
DEBUG=yes

[MODE]
control_mode=temperature

[TEMPERATURE_SOURCE]
TYPE=ipmi
IPMI_SENSOR_NAME=INLET_AIR_TEMP

[CPU_THERMO]
MID_LIMIT=29
HIGH_LIMIT=32
HIGH_FREQUENCY=3.10GHz
MID_FREQUENCY=2.30GHz
LOW_FREQUENCY=1.50GHz
#SLACK_URL=

[GPU_POWER]
MID_LIMIT=70
HIGH_LIMIT=80
HIGH_POWER=100%
MID_POWER=70%
LOW_POWER=40%

[logging]
db_path=/var/lib/hpc_eff/history.db
state_json_path=/var/lib/hpc_eff/state.json
history_length=1000
log_level=INFO
```

#### Picking a temperature source

The reading is pluggable — "bring your own reader":

| `TYPE` | Keys | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ipmi` | `IPMI_SENSOR_NAME` | Runs `ipmitool sensor reading "<name>"` and takes the first number in the output. Confirm the exact sensor name with `ipmitool sensor list` first; it varies by vendor. |
| `http_api` | `HTTP_URL`, optional `HTTP_JSON_PATH` | For a room or facility sensor exposed over HTTP. `HTTP_JSON_PATH=temperature.value` pulls `25.5` out of `{"temperature": {"value": 25.5}}`; omit it if the endpoint returns a plain number. |
| `custom` | `MODULE`, optional `FUNCTION` | `MODULE` is a path to a `.py` file or an importable dotted name; `FUNCTION` (default `read`) must return Celsius as a number. |

> **Warning:** verify the source before enabling cron. Every reader swallows
> its own exceptions and returns nothing on failure, so the regulator applies
> **no frequency change at all** and the node keeps whatever cap it already
> had. A row is still written with `temperature` NULL, and `state.json` shows
> `Temp None C`. A wrong sensor name therefore looks exactly like a healthy
> quiet node. Unlike `co2` mode, there is no second signal to fall back on.

Every section is documented in [configuration.md](configuration.md).

## 2. First run

```bash
sudo hpc-eff
```

> **Warning:** this is not a dry run. There is no `--dry-run` flag. The command
> performs a full evaluation and applies the resulting frequency cap
> immediately. Do it on one node first, ideally a drained one.

With `DEBUG=yes` you get the whole pipeline on stdout. In `co2` mode:

```
[DEBUG] Starting HPC efficiency evaluator...
[DEBUG] control_mode='co2' applied -> FEATURES {...}
[DEBUG] Current electricity price (CZK/MWh): 2431
[DEBUG] Average monthly prices last year (CZK/MWh): [...]
[DEBUG] The current price of 2431 is average (6).
[DEBUG] Last 24 hours CO2 values (g CO2eq/kWh): [...]
[DEBUG] Current CO2 value grade from 1 (low) to 10 (high): 4
[DEBUG] Current rating: 5
2026-08-21 10:00:03 INFO     | Set max frequency: cpupower frequency-set -u 2600000
2026-08-21 10:00:03 INFO     | DB log entry inserted
```

In `temperature` mode there are no price or CO₂ lines. You get the reading and
the band decision instead:

```
[DEBUG] Starting HPC efficiency evaluator...
[DEBUG] control_mode='temperature' applied -> FEATURES {...}
[DEBUG] cpu_thermo applied target 2.30GHz
2026-08-21 10:00:03 INFO     | DB log entry inserted
```

Only an actual band change logs `cpu_thermo applied target`. A steady node
logs `Temperature 27.0°C → target 3.10GHz already set.` instead, which is the
normal case, not a fault.

If the run exits with `Config error: [MODE] control_mode must be one of: …`,
you skipped [step 1](#1-configure).

---

## 3. Verify

Three independent checks. Do all three.

**The cap actually reached the hardware:**

```bash
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq   # kHz
```

This must match the frequency the run applied. If the log says success but
sysfs is unchanged, the frequency tool is a no-op on this node; see
[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md).

**The database got a row.** In `co2` mode:

```bash
sudo sqlite3 /var/lib/hpc_eff/history.db \
  "SELECT timestamp, rating, rating_price, rating_co2, price, co2_current, freq_max
   FROM hpc_eff_log ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

`rating_co2` being NULL means the CO₂ API call failed and the run silently
fell back to the price rating. That is by design, but if it is NULL every
time, your API key or egress is wrong.

In `temperature` mode the rating and price columns stay NULL — nothing
computes them — so look at the temperature columns instead:

```bash
sudo sqlite3 /var/lib/hpc_eff/history.db \
  "SELECT timestamp, temperature, freq_max, gpu_state, gpu_power_limit
   FROM hpc_eff_log ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

`temperature` being NULL means the source could not be read. The reason is not
in the database — the `action_temp` note goes to `state.json` only — so check
there, or rerun by hand with `DEBUG=yes`.

**The state file is current:**

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/hpc_eff/state.json | python3 -m json.tool | head -30
```

Field-by-field meaning: [monitoring.md](monitoring.md).

## 4. Tune the frequencies

This step determines your actual energy saving, and the defaults are almost
certainly wrong for your hardware. Both modes need real frequencies for your
CPU; they store them in different sections.

> **Note:** the Intel and AMD caveats below apply to **both** modes. Read
> [the frequency table](#co2-mode-the-frequency-table) even if you are
> deploying `temperature` mode, because that is where finding a trustworthy
> frequency figure is explained.

### `co2` mode: the frequency table

The CPU model is auto-detected from `/proc/cpuinfo` into one of four keys:

| Detected | Match rule |
|---|---|
| `amd_epyc` | model name contains `EPYC` |
| `intel_e5` | contains `E5-` and `V3` |
| `intel_xeon_gold` | contains `GOLD` |
| `default` | anything else |

Anything not in that list lands on `default`, so on a Xeon Platinum or a
Sapphire Rapids part, the `default` row is what you are tuning.

Building this table from sysfs alone is unreliable, and the two driver
families mislead you in different directions. Both were hit during CESNET's own
rollout across three worker-node generations:

```bash
cpupower frequency-info
```

**On AMD (`acpi-cpufreq` driver):** `scaling_available_frequencies` exists and
lists the real, discrete P-states, usually three, matching what
`cpupower frequency-set -u <TAB>` offers. Read it directly:

```bash
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies
```

**On Intel (`intel_cpufreq`/`intel_pstate` drivers):** that sysfs file does not
exist. Intel exposes a continuous range instead of discrete steps, so there is
no list to read. Worse, the range `cpupower frequency-info` reports as
"hardware limits" (and `cpuinfo_max_freq`) **includes Turbo Boost headroom**. A
Xeon E5-2650v3 with a 2.3 GHz base clock reports a range going up to 3.0 GHz;
take that as your ceiling and the node spends most of its "capped" time still
boosting.

The reliable way to find the real base clock under load is `turbostat`'s
`TSC_MHz` column, which holds steady at the base frequency regardless of Turbo:

```bash
turbostat --quiet --show CPU,frequency sleep 1
```

Cross-check against the CPU model's datasheet base and turbo figures before
committing a table: `cpupower`'s own output cannot be trusted alone on Intel.
This is also why the CPU-model keys in `[frequency_tables]` are hand-curated
per model rather than derived automatically at runtime. An auto-detected table
built from `cpupower` output would silently include Turbo range on Intel
hardware.

Then write frequencies in **MHz, highest first**:

```ini
[frequency_tables]
amd_epyc=2400,2000,1500
```

The rating picks an index across the list: rating 1 → first entry, rating 10 →
last entry, everything else scaled evenly between. The number of entries is
your granularity — three entries means the node only ever has three clock
ceilings. Six to eight gives a smooth response; two gives an on/off switch.

The lowest entry is your worst-case performance floor. Pick it deliberately:
it is what the node runs at during the dirtiest, most expensive hour of the
year, for as long as that hour lasts.

### `temperature` mode: the thermal bands

`[CPU_THERMO]` takes three frequencies rather than a table, and they are
written as strings with a unit (`3.10GHz`), not bare MHz integers as in
`[frequency_tables]`:

```ini
[CPU_THERMO]
MID_LIMIT=29
HIGH_LIMIT=32
HIGH_FREQUENCY=3.10GHz
MID_FREQUENCY=2.30GHz
LOW_FREQUENCY=1.50GHz
```

| Reading | Applied |
|---|---|
| `≥ HIGH_LIMIT` | `LOW_FREQUENCY` |
| `≥ MID_LIMIT` | `MID_FREQUENCY` |
| below `MID_LIMIT` | `HIGH_FREQUENCY`, once 2 °C of headroom is there |

Use the same `turbostat` and datasheet cross-check from
[the frequency table](#co2-mode-the-frequency-table) to pick the three values;
the Intel Turbo problem is identical here.

The two limits are the part that needs your own numbers, because a temperature
threshold only means something against a particular sensor.

The shipped example pairs `MID_LIMIT=29` / `HIGH_LIMIT=32` with
`IPMI_SENSOR_NAME=INLET_AIR_TEMP` — *inlet air* being the air entering the
front of the chassis, typically 18–27 °C in a healthy cold aisle. On that
scale 29 and 32 read as "warm" and "too warm". Against a core- or die-
temperature sensor, which sits at 40–85 °C under load, the same numbers would
put the node permanently in its lowest band.

Nothing in the config or the code states what these defaults were calibrated
against; the sensor name in the example is the only clue. Treat them as an
example, not a recommendation, and set them from what your sensor actually
reports.

```bash
# a quick sense of the range your sensor actually covers
ipmitool sensor reading "INLET_AIR_TEMP"
```

> **Caution:** `[GPU_POWER]` has its own `MID_LIMIT`/`HIGH_LIMIT`, defaulting
> to 70/80 °C — a different scale from `[CPU_THERMO]`'s 29/32. Both sections
> read the *same* sensor, so at most one pair of defaults can suit it. If your
> sensor reports chassis-inlet air, the GPU thresholds never trigger. Set both
> pairs against the range your sensor actually produces.

Power values take either a percentage (`70%`) or absolute Watts (`200`).
A percentage resolves against `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=power.max_limit` read
from the **first GPU only** — the code assumes every GPU in the node is the
same model — and the resulting absolute value is then applied to all of them.
On a node with mixed GPU models, neither form adapts per card.

## 5. Enable the periodic run

```bash
sudo hpc-eff --enable                                # every 10 min
sudo hpc-eff --enable --cron-interval 5              # every 5 min (1–60)
sudo hpc-eff --enable --cron-path /custom/path       # non-default location
sudo hpc-eff --disable                               # remove the cron file
```

This writes `/etc/cron.d/hpc-eff`:

```
*/10 * * * * root /usr/bin/hpc-eff >/dev/null 2>&1
```

Interval guidance differs by mode. In `co2` mode both the spot price and the
CO₂ figures have hourly resolution, so anything below about 5 minutes adds API
traffic without changing the decision. In `temperature` mode the interval is
also your reaction time to a hot room, and it sets how long recovery takes:
upshifts step one band per run, so at 10 minutes a node needs 20 minutes of
sustained cool to get from `LOW_FREQUENCY` back to `HIGH_FREQUENCY`. Shorten
it if that is too slow — no API is being hammered in this mode.

10 minutes is the sensible default for both.
